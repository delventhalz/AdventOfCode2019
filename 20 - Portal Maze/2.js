// --- Part Two ---

// Strangely, the exit isn't open when you reach it. Then, you remember: the
// ancient Plutonians were famous for building recursive spaces.

// The marked connections in the maze aren't portals: they physically connect
// to a larger or smaller copy of the maze. Specifically, the labeled tiles
// around the inside edge actually connect to a smaller copy of the same maze,
// and the smaller copy's inner labeled tiles connect to yet a smaller copy,
// and so on.

// When you enter the maze, you are at the outermost level; when at the
// outermost level, only the outer labels AA and ZZ function (as the start and
// end, respectively); all other outer labeled tiles are effectively walls. At
// any other level, AA and ZZ count as walls, but the other outer labeled tiles
// bring you one level outward.

// Your goal is to find a path through the maze that brings you back to ZZ at
// the outermost level of the maze.

// In the first example above, the shortest path is now the loop around the
// right side. If the starting level is 0, then taking the previously-shortest
// path would pass through BC (to level 1), DE (to level 2), and FG (back to
// level 1). Because this is not the outermost level, ZZ is a wall, and the
// only option is to go back around to BC, which would only send you even
// deeper into the recursive maze.

// In the second example above, there is no path that brings you to ZZ at the
// outermost level.

// Here is a more interesting example:

//                  Z L X W       C
//                  Z P Q B       K

// This path takes a total of 396 steps to move from AA at the outermost layer

// outermost layer?
