// --- Part Two ---

// As you move through the main airlock, the air inside the ship is already
// heating up to reasonable levels. Santa explains that he didn't notice you
// coming because he was just taking a quick nap. The ship wasn't frozen; he
// just had the thermostat set to "North Pole".

// You make your way over to the navigation console. It beeps. "Status:
// Stranded. Please supply measurements from 49 stars to recalibrate."

// "49 stars? But the Elves told me you needed fifty--"

// Santa just smiles and nods his head toward the window. There, in the
// distance, you can see the center of the Solar System: the Sun!

// The navigation console beeps again.
